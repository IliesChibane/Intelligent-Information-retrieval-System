# Intelligent-Information-retrieval-System

An intelligent SRI application using python base on the on CISI collection.

This Python web app application made with Gradio implements various information retrieval models like :

- A vectorial model based on multiple functions like the **Scalar Product**, the **Cosine Measure**, and the **Jaccard Measure**

- A boolean model

- A probabilistic model based on the **BM25** function

- A text mining model using **Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)** for document clustering and **Naive Bayes** for queries classification

- A deep learning model using two **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** architecture **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**
