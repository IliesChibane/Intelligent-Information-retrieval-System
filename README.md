# Intelligent-Information-retrieval-System

An intelligent SRI application using python base on the on CISI collection.

This Python web app application made with Gradio implements various information retrieval modals like :

- The vectorial modal based on multiple functions like the **Scalar Product**, the **Cosine Measure**, and the **Jaccard Measure**

- The boolean modal

- The probabilistic modal based on the **BM25** function

It also implements various Text mining modals like :

- Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)

- Naive Bayes

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

-
